please find the below Test Assessment link kindly complete the test and let me know once its completed.

 

Create the terraform deployment to host a stateless application containerised here:

https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxdemos/hello/

Create the architecture diagram for the deployment using:

https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams

If applicable depends on your chosen approach:

1. Ensure application is deployed behind a load balancer.

2, On the point of the load balancer the application needs to be HA.

3, Ensure that the network hosting of the web application is secured.

4, If application is hosted in a VM build as well the infrastructure for safely access it via

ssh,

5. Make use of service accounts where applicable.

6. Depending on how your application is hosted, propose options for securing access to

the web application itself.

7. Create all the public/private networks needed to secure unwanted access from the

Internet to the infrastructure hosting the web application.

Use a repository on www.github.com to manage all the code parts of the assignment and

provide instructions on how to consume the repository.
